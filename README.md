### Concept

Top Down 2D Detective Murder Mystery

### Overview

After being invited to an invention showcase by the town's most prestigious inventor, along with 6 other guests, you are suddenly tasked with playing detective after the inventor is mysteriously murdered and the guests are trapped in the mansion by an unknown assassin. Explore the mansion, find clues and talk to the other guests to determine who did it and what the murderer hoped to achieve.

Build up trust with the others by talking to them and doing favors to get them in your corner. Ask them questions about the case and any clues you may have found. Eventually, when you have enough information to determine the murderer, you must decide who the mysterious assailant is.

However, you must ensure the guests trust you enough to believe your judgement, or else this murder might be pinned on you!

## Controls

In "And Then There Were Fewer", the player can use Keyboard and Mouse to play the game.

| **Action** | **Keyboard/ Mouse** | **Controller** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move | WASD | Left joystick |
| Select/Pickup Clue | Left click | R2 |
| Aim Player | Mouse movement | Right joystick |
| Interact/Start Conversation | E | Button 3 |

### Key Mechanics

- Collecting Clues/Evidence
- Interviewing People/Collecting Statements
- Trust mechanic: The more trust you gain from characters, the more information they will reveal. This might help the player to discover the murderer.

### Gameplay

- The player will need to explore the various rooms to look for clues. This will include moving objects around the room. Items collected will be stored in the player's inventory, and can also be used to question characters.

- Certain rooms will require the player to solve a puzzle. Hints for puzzles can be found around the house, or revealed in conversations while speaking to characters.

- There will also be dialogue options to advance conversations and reveal background information about characters, as well as potential agendas
- The ability to intimidate suspects; This can either help or hinder the investigation, depending on how it's done

The Final Verdict is decided by the player; The suspect that is named is sentenced, and only after will it be revealed if the player caught the right person, or sentenced an innocent soul to die (similar to _Among Us_)

### Key Inspirations

- Poirot
- And Then There Were None
- Sherlock Holmes
- Among Us
- Danganronpa

### Game Elements

**Mood/Atmosphere**

The feeling of being in a Sherlock or Poirot novel. "And Then There Were None" would also serve as a key inspiration. We want there to be a heavy feeling of suspense, and to emulate thrillers.

With a cast of 6 characters, there will also be an emphasis on the double faced nature of humanity. How things are not always as they appear on the surface.

### Background Characters

These characters roles were cut for design reasons.

#### John

Nervous character always searching for his father and fixing the problems he causes.

#### Frederick

The father of John, will do stuff at random like carrying a chicken head to scare possums or onions to wear off racoons. Loud and rude (Motive he was looking around the mansion and stumbled upon a secret lab of the scientist) .

SuperNatural and out there ideas for characters:

1. Cult members (maybe multiple characters could be part of this cult or just some background characters like the servants of the mansion. Not including the main character. Or two groups of actual characters could be members from cult rivals that went to the party to steal the invention from the inventor and they try to kill each other or mess with each other.)

2: Shape Shifting aliens: Searching for the inventor's secrets they can shapeshift into other characters to confuse the protagonist and pose as them to take the blame.

3: Interdimensional Traveler: Wanted to take the inventor to a different dimension for the hell of it. Also this character is a talking duck
